        Instructions for Analysis:
        1. Analyze planetary positions:
           - Check each planet's house position, degrees, and status (exalted/debilitated/neutral)
           - Note any retrograde planets and their significance
           - Identify combust planets and their effects
           - Analyze Rashi (zodiac sign) placement and lordship
           - Consider Nakshatra positions and their lords

        2. Special Attention Points:
           - Ascendant position and its aspects
           - Moon sign and its strength (based on degrees and house)
           - Position of major planets (Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn)
           - Rahu-Ketu axis and its influence
           - Any planetary conjunctions or special yogas

        3. Divisional Charts Analysis:
           - D9 (Navamsa) positions for relationship/marriage insights
           - D10 (Dashamamsa) for career analysis
           - D2, D4, D60 positions for additional depth

        Analyze the following birth chart positions for accurate monthly transits and predictions.

        Instructions for Monthly Analysis:
        1. Analyze transit effects based on natal positions:
           - Ascendant in ${kundli_data.kundli.Ascendant.rashi} at ${kundli_data.kundli.Ascendant.degrees}¬∞
           - Moon in ${kundli_data.kundli.Moon.rashi} (House ${kundli_data.kundli.Moon.house})
           - Sun in ${kundli_data.kundli.Sun.rashi} (House ${kundli_data.kundli.Sun.house})
           - Other key planets and their house positions
           - Major planetary aspects and conjunctions
           - Relationship between transiting and natal planets
           - Dasha-antardasha periods
           - Special yogas forming during transits

        2. Pay special attention to:
           - Transit over natal positions of major planets
           - Rahu-Ketu axis transits
           - Saturn's transit aspects (sade-sati if applicable)
           - Jupiter's beneficial transits
           - Mars and Venus periods for relationship/career matters

        Requirements:
        1. Generate exactly 12 predictions in chronological order (January first, then February, and so on)
        2. Each month should include:
           - Specific dates and timings for important events based on planetary transits
           - 3-5 challenging days where caution is advised (when malefic planets aspect natal positions)
           - 3-5 opportunity days (when benefic planets form positive aspects)
           - Impact of transiting planets on career, relationships, and health
           - Remedial measures for challenging periods

        3. Focus Areas per Month:
           - Financial opportunities (based on 2nd, 11th house transits)
           - Career developments (based on 10th house and its lord)
           - Relationship matters (based on 7th house and Venus transits)
           - Health and wellbeing (based on 1st, 6th house transits)
           - Personal growth (based on 5th, 9th house aspects)
